# Mosaic MNIST Dataset
Mosaic MNIST is a dataset of images composed of MNIST digits, arranged to resemble larger MNIST digits. Each image comes with metadata detailing the label of the composite digit (typically the ground truth for relevant machine learning tasks) and the identity of each component digit, to allow for learning localization as well.
